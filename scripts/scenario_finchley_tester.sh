This Bash file will show you the scenario in which Eureka Server is in edgware version and the Client is finchley.
We will use a edgware Eureka Tester app to use a load balanced RestTemplate to find the "client" application.

We will do it in the following way:

01) Run eureka-edgware-server (Eureka Server)
02) Wait for the app (eureka-edgware-server) to boot (port: 8761)
03) Run eureka-finchley-client (App registers in Eureka)
04) Wait for the app (eureka-finchley-client) to boot (port: 8778)
05) Wait for the app (eureka-finchley-client) to register in Eureka Server
06) Run eureka-edgware-tester (Will call the client app from Eureka)
07) Wait for the app (eureka-edgware-tester) to boot (port: 7779)
08) Wait for the app (eureka-edgware-tester) to register in Eureka Server
09) Now we have a edgware Eureka Server, edgware app that will call a finchley app
10) Call localhost:7779/check to make the tester send a request to the client that will find the server
11) Assert that the flow is working
12) Kill eureka-edgware-server
13) Run eureka-finchley-server (Eureka Server)
14) Wait for the app (eureka-finchley-server) to boot (port: 8761)
15) Wait for the app (eureka-finchley-client) to register in Eureka Server
16) Wait for the app (eureka-edgware-tester) to register in Eureka Server
17) Now we have a finchley Eureka Server, edgware app that will call a finchley app
18) Call localhost:7779/check to make the tester send a request to the client that will find the server
19) Assert that the flow is working
20) Kill eureka-finchley-server
21) Kill eureka-finchley-tester
22) Kill eureka-edgware-client
